## User Settings
You have the option to change a few Settings. These are found directly on top of the script:

   1. Up/Down - Unsafe Movement but does not require Smoke Bombs for Rebuy and Heal
   2. Curved Movement - Does a curve when changing directions
   3. Maevement - A Mix between Random, Circle and Curved Movements
   
##### Luma Options
   1. Wait on Luma - Stops the script and waits for User input
   2. Disconnect on Luma - Stops the script and closes the game
   
##### Number of Wiplumps
   - You have to change the number according to the wiplumps you have in your team
   - This is needed so the script knows when to return to heal
   - min 2, max 5
   
##### Amount of TemCards before going to rebuy
   - obvious, set the amount of TemCards thrown before refill at Temporium
   - min 1, max 99

##### Your VM Name or Number
   - This is only for Telegram notification if you have multiple VM's to know which VM found a Luma
   - Set the Name your VM is called, needs to be inside the "", for example `vm = "TemBot VM Nr 3"`
